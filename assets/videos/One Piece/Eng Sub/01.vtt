WEBVTT

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.760
Wealth, fame, power...

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.970
attained everything
this world has to offer.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.590
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.770
and set out in search
of something to find

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.100
ONE PIECE!

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.610
Compasses only cause delays

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.350
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:11.460
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.170
When it comes to personal storms,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.140
and pretend it isn't there!

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.360
and set out in search
of something to find

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.970
We are, We are on the cruise!

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.040
We are!

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.730
Whoa...

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.210
"I'm Luffy! The Man Who's
Gonna be King of the Pirates!"

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.690
No worries!

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.020
A whirlpool of that size
poses no problem to this ship!

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.530
Miss.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.860
May I have this dance?

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.030
Alright!

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.340
Not again...

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.510
Batter out!

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.840
What're you doing? You suck!

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.230
This thing's heavy!

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.730
Must be filled with booze, then!

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.060
It's all ours now!

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.540
Ship off the starboard stern!

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.680
There's a pirate flag on its mast!

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.650
It's a pirate ship!
Enemy raid! Enemy raid!

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.770
Captain! Pirates!

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.770
What?!

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.340
Everyone, stay calm!

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.970
Stay calm!

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.180
Follow instructions
in a calm manner!

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.280
Fire!

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.230
Coby!

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.500
Y-Yes, ma'am?!

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.100
Who's the most beautiful
of all on these seas?

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.010
T-This ship's captain,
Alvida-sama, of course!

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.110
Well done!

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.910
T-Thank you!

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.880
Alvida-sama.
This is our first prey in a while.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.220
That's right!

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.060
Alright! Start pounding the ship!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.870
Men! Show them the terror of
Iron Club Alvida, the woman pirate!

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.880
Coby! What're you doing?!

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.350
I-I'm not good
at this sort of thing...

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.020
Hmm?! Are you tryin'
to give me backtalk?!

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.960
P-Please, anything but the club!

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.590
Then get yer ass in gear!

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.650
We won't take yer lives, but
we will take all yer valuables!

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.390
Anyone who tries to fight back'll
wind up at the bottom of the ocean!

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.400
Hello...

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.010
There's no one in here, right?

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.670
What a relief...

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.250
That's a rather large barrel...

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.960
Who're you?!
Never seen you before!

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.350
Hey, coward!

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.150
Are you hidin' out in a
place like this again?!

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.420
N-No! I thought I'd haul this
big barrel of alcohol over...

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.590
We'll lighten it for ya!

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.920
I was just feelin' thirsty!

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.560
You can't! Alvida-sama
will kill us if she finds out!

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.230
Then you just need
to keep yer mouth shut!

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.270
Right, Coby?

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.540
Y-Yes! You're right!

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.240
Thing's pretty heavy!

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.510
Can't wait!

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.840
Hold yer horses!
I'll bust it right open!

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:29.970
I slept great!

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.640
Huh?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.180
Who're you guys?

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.940
No, who are you?!

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.080
That guy's gonna catch cold
if he sleeps there, y'know.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.080
You did that!

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.490
Are you toyin' with us even
when you know we're pirates?!

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.260
Man, I'm hungry!
You got any food?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.790
Listen when people are talking!

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.300
You damn kid!

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.100
Die!

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.520
What's the big idea?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.520
W-Who are you?!

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.720
Me?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.730
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.
Nice to meetcha!

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.440
What the... What just happened?

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.710
What's with them?

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.940
R-Run, hurry! If they come back
with their friends, you'll be killed!

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.310
But man, I sure am hungry!

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.280
How can you be so carefree?!

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.790
There are still lots
more of them up on deck!

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.320
C'mon! This way!

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.660
H-H-Hey! Not this way!

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.270
Food! Food! Food! Yes! Food!

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.170
Actually, they might
not find us in here!

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.610
Which should I choose?
This box? Ooh, jackpot!

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.340
These look great!

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.620
M-My name is Coby.
You're Luffy-san, right?

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.250
That was incredible just now!
How did you do that?!

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.290
These things are great!

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.960
Is this a pirate ship?

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.960
No, it's a passenger ship that's
being raided by Alvida-sama.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.730
Well, it doesn't matter.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.940
Do you know if there
are any boats onboard?

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.240
I-I think so...

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.540
My ship got swallowed
by this giant whirlpool...

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.640
You mean that whirlpool?!
No one could survive that!

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.420
Boy, was that a real surprise!

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.820
Are you one of those pirates, too?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.590
It was on that fateful day...

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:14.100
That day, I got in a boat on
the outskirts of town to go fishing...

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:25.880
...but it turned out the boat was
actually headed for a pirate ship.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.610
It's been two years since...

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.080
In exchange for my life,
I've been forced to be a chore boy.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.290
Man, you're dumb and stupid!

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.250
You're brutally honest...

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.920
If you don't like it, then run away!

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.320
I-I can't! No way! No way!

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.330
Just the thought
of Alvida-sama finding me...

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.460
...frightens me and makes
me weak in the knees--

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.030
Oh, you're a wimp, too?

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.070
Man, I hate you!

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.210
Hey, now! Quit dawdling!

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.980
Haul it all off before
the navy gets here!

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.980
Anyone caught dawdling
gets a taste of my iron club!

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.920
--What a haul!
--Seems like a pretty rich ship!

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.920
Hey! You'll get the club
if she catches you slackin' off!

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.890
Oh, whoops!

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.620
Yeah, one hit from
that and you're a goner!

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.260
Alvida-sama!

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.500
It's bad!

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.300
What is it?! You're annoying me!

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.730
A b-b-barrel!

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.570
M-M-Monster!

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.730
Huh?!

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.770
Who're you calling a monster?!

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.820
N-No... Some weird guy
popped out of a barrel...

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.250
He might be...
a bounty hunter...

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.020
What?!

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.080
Yeah... That's right...

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.250
If only I had the courage to
drift the ocean in a barrel...

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.250
...there's actually
something I want to do, too...

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:17.590
Umm... What compelled you
to set out onto the sea, Luffy-san?

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.090
I'm gonna be
the King of the Pirates!

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.560
--K-K-King of the Pirates?!
--Yep.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.260
--Are you serious?!
--Yeah.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.000
Wait, you're a pirate, Luffy-san?!

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.930
Yep.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.000
What about your crew?!

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Don't got one.
I'm just about to look for one.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.180
K-K-King of the Pirates is
the title given to the person...

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.810
...who obtains everything in this world!

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.690
That means seeking the great
treasure of wealth, fame, and power...

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.190
...the One Piece!

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.190
Yup!

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.330
Yup?! Pirates all over the
world are after that treasure!

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.590
Me too!

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.160
No way! No way, no way, no way!
Absolutely no way!

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.900
There's no way you can stand at
the apex of this Great Pirate Era!

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.570
No way! No way!

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.410
Why did you hit me?

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.610
Just because.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.610
But it's all right.
I'm used to it now...

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.890
It's not about whether I can or not.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.420
I'm gonna do it because I want to.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.590
I've decided to be the King of the Pirates,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.260
so if I die fighting for that,
that's fine with me!

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.100
Now, then! My belly's full--
guess I'll go get me a boat!

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.770
I wonder if they'll give me one if I ask.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.810
Hopefully they're generous.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.950
I never once thought about it...

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.880
Do you suppose I can do it, too?

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.680
If I'm prepared to die for it?

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.250
Do what?

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:58.960
Do you think...
even I could join the navy?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.690
Navy?

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.860
Yes! Catching bad guys is my dream!

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.730
It's been my dream ever since I
was little! Do you think I can do it?!

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.070
How should I know?

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.440
No! I'll do it! If I'm gonna be a
chore boy for the rest of my life,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:18.010
then I'll break out of here and
catch even Alvida-sama-- no, Alvida!

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:29.150
You're gonna team up
with him to catch who?!

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.820
Huh, Coby?!

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.540
You don't seem to be Zoro, the pirate hunter.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.410
Zoro?

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.350
Coby!

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:01.620
Who's the most beautiful
of all on these seas?!

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.120
O-Of course that would be--

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.160
Who's this big chunky lady?

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.700
--Chunky?
--Not good...

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.340
You runt!

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.680
Let's go!

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.050
Why, you...

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.090
Whoops!

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.480
It's not fair to attack from behind!

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.150
It's not fair to attack all at once!

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.760
Gotcha!

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.070
Gum-Gum...

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.380
...Rocket!

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.450
What?!

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.550
L-Luffy-san... What are you?

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.790
Me?

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.060
I'm a rubber person!

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.730
A rubber person?
You can't be serious!

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.770
You've eaten a Devil's Fruit, haven't you?

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.000
Yeah! The Gum-Gum Fruit!

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.340
I see! I'd heard the rumors,
but I guess they really do exist!

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.280
You also seem pretty skilled.
You a bounty hunter?

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.520
I'm a pirate!

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.790
A pirate?! Hah!
All by yourself?!

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.290
It's just me right now, but I'll
find some more sooner or later!

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:22.760
Yeah... Ten crewmen sounds good to me!

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.700
Ah, so you're a pirate too, huh?!

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.530
Then that means you
and me are enemies, huh?

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.300
--L-Luffy-san! Let's get out of here!
--Why?

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.710
You saw how powerful her club is!

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.980
In these waters, she's the most--

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.620
I've decided to be
the King of the Pirates,

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.120
so if I die fighting for that,
that's fine with me!

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.060
I'm the most what?!

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.260
T-T-The...

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:03.000
The most ugly,
cragged old hag ever!

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.650
What did you say?!

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.080
I... I'm going to join the navy!

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.890
And then I'm gonna beat up pirates!

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.490
Do you even know
what you're saying?!

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:29.060
I do! I'm gonna do
what I want to do!

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.260
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna join the navy...

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.900
...and catch your lousy ass!

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.770
You damn pipsqueak!

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.270
No regrets! No regrets!
I said it! I fought! For my dream!

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.310
Well said!

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.320
That doesn't work!

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.320
What?!

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.990
'Cause I'm rubber!

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.160
Gum-Gum...

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.770
...Pistol!

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.860
The sky is so blue...

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.340
Hey!

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.700
--Yes?!
--Yes?!

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.270
Give Coby a small boat!

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.240
He's gonna join the navy!
Keep your mouths shut and let him go!

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.010
--R-Right!
--R-Right!

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.220
Luffy-san!

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.190
It's the navy!

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:11.660
Oh, perfect timing!
You should go see 'em!

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.100
But I'm a pirate! I'm outta here!

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.160
Get serious!

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.170
I can't just join the navy like this!

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.170
I'll be captured instead!

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.490
Looks like we managed to get away...

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.790
Whew, that was fun!

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.030
Umm, Luffy-san.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.270
If you're heading for the One Piece,

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.300
--that means you're going
to the Grand Line, right?
--Yeah.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.610
That place is also referred to
as a pirate graveyard, you know.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.810
Yeah. That's why I need a strong crew.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.650
What about that pirate hunter guy?
What's he like?

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.920
You mean Zoro? I heard he's
being held prisoner at a navy base.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.890
Aw, he's a weakling?

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.890
Nothing of the sort!
He's as terrifying as a demon!

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.330
Why are you asking about him?

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.570
Thought I might have him join
my crew if he's a good guy!

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.770
You're being reckless again!

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.470
C'mon, he might be a good guy!

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.740
He's been caught
because he's a bad guy!

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.840
No! No way, no way, no way!
Absolutely no--

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.050
Why did you hit me?

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.550
Just because!

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.070
"To be continued"

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:09.280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:16.220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:23.390
before someone else could
beat me to it

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:37.570
If the world is going to change

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:44.580
before I can even attain my dream

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:51.620
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

00:23:51.620 --> 00:24:05.040
so that my memories won't fade

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.280
Hey! I'll untie your ropes,
so join my crew!

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.080
I refuse to team up with a pirate!

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.380
Oh, come on. You're already
known as an evil bounty hunter.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.750
Screw that! I ain't done a single
thing I regret! And I never will!

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.220
So I ain't gonna be a pirate!

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.290
I've decided you're gonna join me!

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.990
Quit deciding on your own!

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.390
On the next episode of One Piece!

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.660
"Enter the Great Swordsman!
Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro"

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.830
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
